This is a food donation tracker made using python

Our primary goal is to combat food hunger by ensuring that every citizen has access to nutritious food through an efficient and sustainable system. We strive to bridge the gap between surplus food and those in need, promoting food security, reducing waste, and fostering a community where no one goes hungry.
